We have moved to our new purpose-designed offices, some 3 miles up the road and we are now located in Rochford, Essex. Please update your contact details. See the Contact Us section of the website.

Also, IMH Technologies is now the Dranetz European Service Centre for the 4400/PX5 range of products and we hold spare stocks of boards and colour touch screens here in the UK to service the whole of Europe.

The first tests in the UK with a PSL Industrial Power Corrupter have been successfully conducted at a Semi Conductor Equipment Manufacturer in the South of England. So successful and useful were the results from the IPC that the client is planning to purchase an instrument so that it is available in their test bay permanently!
